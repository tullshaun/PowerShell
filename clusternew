From your image:



Node VMSQLP85 has:
Assigned Vote = 1
Current Vote = 0





This means the node should have a vote, but currently it is not contributing to quorum. That can happen for several reasons:









üîç Possible Causes:





Node is not part of current quorum
It might be marked as ‚ÄúUp‚Äù in the Cluster Manager, but not healthy enough to participate in quorum.
Node is in a ‚ÄúPaused‚Äù or ‚ÄúIsolated‚Äù state
Even though its status shows ‚ÄúUp,‚Äù it could be paused or in a state where it is not participating in cluster voting.
Witness configuration
If you‚Äôre using dynamic quorum or dynamic witness, the cluster may have adjusted votes dynamically to maintain quorum stability.
Network communication issues
The node might not be able to communicate properly with the other nodes even though it appears ‚ÄúUp‚Äù.
Manually evicted or recently rejoined
The node might have been recently added or recovered and not fully reintegrated into voting.










‚úÖ How to Check and Resolve:







1. 

Check node status more deeply





Run this in PowerShell on any cluster node:

Get-ClusterNode

(Get-ClusterNode "VMSQLP85").NodeWeight

(Get-Cluster).QuorumArbitrationTimeMax
Get-ClusterQuorum

(Get-Cluster).QuorumArbitrationTimeMax
Get-ClusterQuorum



# Get basic cluster info
Write-Host "===== Cluster Quorum Summary =====" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Get-ClusterQuorum

Write-Host "`n===== Node Voting Status =====" -ForegroundColor Cyan
$clusterNodes = Get-ClusterNode

$nodeInfo = $clusterNodes | ForEach-Object {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        NodeName      = $_.Name
        Status        = $_.State
        NodeWeight    = $_.NodeWeight
        AssignedVote  = (Get-ClusterNode $_.Name).NodeWeight
        CurrentVote   = (Get-Cluster | Get-ClusterGroup "Cluster Group" | Get-ClusterResource | Where-Object {$_.ResourceType -eq "Cluster IP Address"}).OwnerNode -eq $_.Name
    }
}

$nodeInfo | Format-Table -AutoSize

Write-Host "`n===== Witness Type =====" -ForegroundColor Cyan
$quorumInfo = Get-ClusterQuorum

switch ($quorumInfo.QuorumType) {
    "NodeMajority" { "No witness used." }
    "NodeAndDiskMajority" { "Disk Witness: $($quorumInfo.WitnessResource)" }
    "NodeAndFileShareMajority" { "File Share Witness: $($quorumInfo.WitnessSharePath)" }
    "CloudWitness" { "Cloud Witness: $($quorumInfo.WitnessSharePath)" }
    default { "Witness Type Unknown or not configured." }
}




Windows Cluster Node Has Assigned Vote = 1, but Current Vote = 0







üîç What This Means:





Assigned Vote = 1 ‚Üí The node is configured to have a vote.
Current Vote = 0 ‚Üí The node is not currently contributing to the cluster quorum.
