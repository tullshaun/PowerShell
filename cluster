(Get-ClusterQuorum).QuorumResource | Get-ClusterParameter

This one-line script gets the cluster's quorum resource and then lists its parameters, which will include the witness path.

PowerShell

(Get-ClusterQuorum).QuorumResource | Get-ClusterParameter
What the output means:

If you're using a File Share Witness, the output will include a property named SharePath, showing the UNC path to the witness share (e.g., \\Server\WitnessShare).

If you're using a Disk Witness, the output will show the details of the cluster disk being used.

If you're using a Cloud Witness, you'll see properties like CloudWitnessName and CloudAccountName.

View Node Quorum Votes
This script lists each node in the cluster and shows its configured vote and its current, dynamic vote.

PowerShell

Get-ClusterNode | Select-Object Name, State, NodeWeight, DynamicWeight
What the output columns mean:

Name: The name of the cluster node.

State: The current status of the node (e.g., Up, Down).

NodeWeight: This is the configured vote. A value of 1 means the node has a vote. A value of 0 means it doesn't. You can set this manually to remove a node's vote.

DynamicWeight: This is the actual vote the node currently has. The cluster automatically manages this. A running node will have a DynamicWeight of 1. If a node goes down, the cluster changes its DynamicWeight to 0 to maintain the quorum.
