Solutions for Reducing Alert Fatigue

1. Prioritize Critical Alerts

• Use a dedicated mailbox for critical events (e.g., server down) with sound alerts.

• Add distinct visual and audio cues to emphasize urgency.

2. Control Flapping Alerts

• Set thresholds (e.g., CPU 100% for 10 minutes) to avoid unnecessary noise.

3. Reduce False Positives

• Suppress alerts during maintenance or planned outages.

• Regularly review and refine alert rules.
