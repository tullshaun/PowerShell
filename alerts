Solutions for Reducing Alert Fatigue

1. Prioritize Critical Alerts

• Use a dedicated mailbox for critical events (e.g., server down) with sound alerts.

• Add distinct visual and audio cues to emphasize urgency.

2. Control Flapping Alerts

• Set thresholds (e.g., CPU 100% for 10 minutes) to avoid unnecessary noise.

3. Reduce False Positives

• Suppress alerts during maintenance or planned outages.

• Regularly review and refine alert rules.



Advanced Detailed Monitoring

• SolarWinds is ideal for identifying memory peaks, CPU usage, and performance trends with minimal overhead.

• For deeper analysis:

• Log metrics every minute for 24 hours (~100 MB/day/server).

• Use binary log files (.blg) to minimize disk space usage.

• Auto-delete logs older than 24 hours to maintain storage efficiency.

• Summary:

Efficiently track memory and CPU metrics while conserving disk space using a rolling 24-hour window. This approach balances visibility, performance, and resource optimization.
