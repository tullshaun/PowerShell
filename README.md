This book will allow you to unleash the power of PowerShell and allow you to automate many of your day to day administration tasks.

Now that PowerShell has become open-source and enabled for cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux) support,
Powershell is now a technology that administrators must learn to become more efficient and productive.


If you are looking for a practical PowerShell book, where you can learn PowerShell with useful real-world commands rather than wading through masses of text, then this is the book for you. The layout of this book is designed so the first half will guide you step by step, by using the fundamental PowerShell commands, and gradually build them out. The second half will provide you with example code, so you can manage and retrieve information about your systems, and show you how you can use and apply PowerShell commands to manage your IT environment.

By reading this book and running the commands, you will be able to get an overall view of what PowerShell can do. The aim is to get you up and running as rapidly as possible, with example code provided for the area you are interested in. So, if you want the ability to manage your IT environment from a command-line shell environment, you want to automate many of your manual tasks, and you want to learn a new skill. Then dive in and letâ€™s get started.


What I will reiterate: this book is a practical text, it is code-heavy rather than text-heavy. So to get the most out of this book, you will learn best by running, testing and changing the code provided, which will allow you to build your knowledge and your own PowerShell code repository in no time at all.
